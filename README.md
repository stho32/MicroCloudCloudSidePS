# MicroCloudCloudSidePS

This module contains the powershell implementation for the cloud-side apis which vms use to communicate and integrate with their environment

## Creating an integrating vm

  - in a new fresh vm install the windows operating system the way you want
  - install the command line git client so it can be called from cmd/powershell without path
  - create the folder C:\MicroCloud and go there
  - git clone https://github.com/stho32/MicroCloudCloudSidePS
  - run integrate.ps1 from C:\MicroCloud\MicroCloudCloudSidePS as administrator
